# Project One - Pok√©mon Gotta Catch 'Em All! #


What are the objectives of the game?
 - To catch as many fruits as you can before time runs out!

How do you play the game?
- Use left and right arrows to move the Pokemon to catch the falling fruits
- Avoid falling bombs as they will deduct a point from your score
- Missing a fruit will deduct a life
- Game will end when timer runs out or you run out of lives

Feel free to fork and I welcome any feedback on how to improve the game!


What are the technologies used?
- Lots of positioning (from top and from left)
- Arrays checking the position of each fruit
- setIntervals for each function (adding fruits to the game, removing missed fruits, how to check if the player scored) and setTimeouts

Unsolved problems?
- How to add more characters to the game
- Adding more challenges to the game
